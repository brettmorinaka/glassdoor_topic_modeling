The process took 3+ months. I interviewed at General Assembly.,General Assembly,"One of the worst interview processes I have ever participated in. Disorganized, non-communicative and unprofessional.

She followed up an hour later saying it was a mistake and that she would check on my status. Heard back about a week later with a rejection, even though I was commended for my in person interview and my successful completion of the task. They went with someone who had a big name law firm on their resume, which they should have disclosed that they wanted that in the ad if that’s what they were looking for, instead of wasting 3 months of my time.

They basically want to see why you are interested in the program and if you are ready to take on the commitment. The questionnaires are very in-depth and will take some time to complete: it will ask you to describe your goals, search for networking events around your area, search for open jobs, etc. The project is presented like a real assignment, and will require you to put in the time and effort to complete: I enjoyed this a lot since I felt like I was able to challenge my creativity and see the outcome of my efforts. For the in-person interview, they go over the submitted project with you and ask you the details of it- why you chose to design it this way, what challenges you encountered, etc., and they will also go over the program in detail. The whole process was pretty casual, but they do make you ""work for it"" in the sense that they not only want to see that you are committed, but to make sure that you yourself are aware of the responsibility and the time commitment this program would take. They were very easy to communicate with, and I was able to have all my questions answered.

When would I use a Python dictionary to store data, instead of another data structure?,Python Dictionary can be used to store data when the data consist of key-value pairs . It also helps in data lookups.,2. When writing Python code, why would you write a function?,Functions are define for the purposes of computations and code re-usability,3. I have a Python list named mylist. What is the difference between `sorted(mylist)` and `mylist.sort()`?,With sorted(mylist) : Return a new list containing all items from the iterable in ascending order.,And with mylist.sort() : Returns None because it is not iterable.,4. I have a Pandas DataFrame named users. One of the Series is named age. I run this code: `users[users.age > 25]`. What does this code return, and how does it ""work""?,The code selects the ages column and filter out all ages greater than 25 based on the users DataFrame object.,5. What is the difference between a bar plot and a histogram?,Histogram shows the distributions of some variables whiles bar plot is used to compare variables with respect to a certain descriptive statistics.,6. What is the difference between regression and classification problems, and how can you convert a regression problem into a classification problem?,Regression problem is the one that predicts some continuous variable whiles classification problem is the one that predicts some binary or multi-class variable. You can convert a regression problem into a classification problem by adding a binary or multi-class response variable to the independent variables. But if you decide not to add a binary or multi-class response variable you can apply clustering technique like Kmeans on the data to make it a classification problem.,7. When Netflix predicts the number of stars that you will use to rate a movie, are they solving a regression or classification problem?,They are solving a classification problem since the ratings are in the range of 1-5 stars.,8. What's wrong with training and testing a machine learning model on the same data?,It is important not to test the prediction of an estimator on the data used to fit the estimator as this would not be evaluating the performance of the estimator on new data. This is why datasets are often split into train and test data.,9. What is the purpose of model evaluation procedures that ""hold out"" data, like train/test split and cross-validation?,The purpose of the “hold out” like train/test split is used to prevent the introduction of bias into the model and hence Over-Fitting.,10. What are a few metrics (single numbers) I might use to evaluate how well a regression model is doing?,R-Square, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Median Absolute Error,11. Why is a confusion matrix useful for evaluating the performance of a classifier?,The diagonal elements represent the number of points for which the predicted label is equal to the true label, while off-diagonal elements are those that are mislabeled by the classifier. The higher the diagonal values of the confusion matrix the better, indicating many correct predictions. It also helps to determine the True positives, False Negative, True Negative etc.,12. I built a machine learning model to solve a binary classification problem. The accuracy of my classifier is 99%, and the AUC is 0.51. Is my model doing well? Why or why not?,The model is not doing well because the AUC is about 0.51, which means that the classifier is not able to differentiate between the labels, hence a random classifier. The higher the AUC, the better the model and vice versa. However, the AUC is computed with the prediction scores specified as a parameter in the AUC method.,13. With regard to machine learning models, why should I care the about bias-variance trade-off?,We should care because bias introduces under-fitting into the model whiles variance introduces over-fitting into the model, so we need to worry about this issue so that our model can generalize well to unseen data.,14. How does regularization reduce overfitting?,Regularization reduce over-fitting by penalizing the parameters in the model as a result of using L1 or L2 penalty regularization terms. When we add a regularization term to the loss function, we shrink the weights a little, increasing the bias while reducing variance.,15.

After receiving a call from one of their employees asking we set up a time to have a phone interview 2 days later yet when the new scheduled time arrived I never received a call so I called and left a message. A few hours later my interviewee called emailed me saying he was ""stuck on the train"" and asked if we could reschedule during the weekend. When I suggested a time it was rejected as he was ""moving this weekend"" which caused me to question why it would have been suggested in the first place. I was pretty much ready to tell them to forget about it but figured I might as well continue on anyway and after a brief phone conversation was invited into the office for a face to face interview.,The in-person interview was ok but it was clear there was no order at all. I met with a few different people - most were fairly welcoming but a few seemed to be downright rude (but hey, different personalities - I get it). I was more concerned that it seemed like there was no order or reason for who I was talking to and the questions were weak. The majority of the workforce struck me as trust-fund babies...albeit intelligent ones. Their ""trust no one over 30"" mentality (seriously, I didn't see a single person anywhere near middle age) came off to me as unwarranted hubris as well. Still, the company seems like they have a bright future but I think it was clear to both themselves as well as myself that I was not a good fit. Unfortunately, I had to initiate to find out their decision - I was told in the follow-up that they ""just made"" the decision to go with someone else the day I inquired but being that they already had clear issues with communication prior, I'm skeptical that's the case.",Easy Interview,Negative Experience," No real difficult questions.

"I applied online. The process took 4 weeks. I interviewed at General Assembly (New York, NY).",General Assembly,"Contacted me out of the blue with no prior warning and spoke with one of the management (surprisingly) for about 20 minutes and immediately scheduled an interview the next day. Proceeded to have a 30 minute conversation with him that was very similar to the first (very easy going people, very nice, but still very much on their game). They emailed me immediately after the call and asked me up to NYC for an in-person interview at their HQ two days later. Their HQ is beautiful, the people are great, very open environment. I really cannot say a bad thing about them. They waited another week before scheduling yet another interview (sales pitch).

I applied online. I interviewed at General Assembly.,General Assembly,"Applied for a position that was filled so was contacted about a different position opening asking to interview me. I first had a 30/45 minute phone interview with pretty general 'screen' interview questions and explaining more about the position. I was then brought in for an in person interview with two people. The interview was relatively informal and more of a conversation. Why GA? Why the role?
