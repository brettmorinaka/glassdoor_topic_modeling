N/A,Zillow,"I applied for the position and 5 days later received an email to schedule a phone screening. The recruiter called me about 8 minutes later than the scheduled time. The phone interview lasted about 20 minutes where I was asked the typical phone screen questions. My experience aligned with how several others described. The questions seemed scripted, it almost felt like I was talking to a robot, and it was not at all conversational. Once she was done asking me her questions, she was done talking to me. At that point I felt she was in a rush to read her script about the position and get off the phone. I interviewed on a Wednesday and she said they would let me know either way if I was moving on by that Friday. It is just short of 2 months later and I still have heard nothing, which I can assume means I am not moving on to the next round. Unfortunately, I did not interview as well as I had hoped (It’s been a while since I’ve interviewed and I think my nerves got to me), and expected that I would not move forward. I still feel Zillow is a great company which is reflected in the company reviews, and will continue to pursue a position with you. With your responsiveness to reviews, I hope you use the information in your interview reviews to improve your process.

They said it wouldn't be a problem and that they would simply do a video conference interview in place of an in person interview. They said it was common and won't be a problem. I got the second interview and it went great. A recruiter followed up the following week saying they wanted to have the final interview and asked when I could visit the office.

After an initial email of interest from a recruiter, it took ~10 days to finally have a phone screen with said recruiter. It then took several weeks to get a phone screen with the hiring manager, another several weeks for the 1st in-person loop, etc. Uber literally hired a new CEO in less time than I interacted with Zillow.,I also received no feedback during the waiting periods of 10+ days between each stage, which in my personal experience of hiring teams is in rather poor taste. Perhaps strangest of all, when I did receive feedback it was overwhelmingly positive at every stage. Keeping a candidate you're excited about in the dark for long periods and ultimately stringing them along for months seems a very strange hiring strategy.,At the end of the day, I felt the team was either not being transparent with me about concerns they had with my candidacy, and / or that the hiring manager really didn't have a good sense of overall team needs and how to hire for them.

The first interview in person after the tech talk was 45 minutes long: consisted of mainly why am I interested in this position, walking through my resume and at the end I had a problem which was not too hard and aimed to evaluate my analytical thinking skills.,The amazing part is that I heard back in couple of days to schedule next interview. It was three hour long video interview. It might seem that it is long, but the time passed by very quickly and questions were aligned in a way that behavioral are mixed with technical, so you kind of relax for a bit during behavioral questions. During that video conference, I spoke with four people in the team, first two were mainly consisting of technical questions, one coding, two analytical problems, walking through resume and talking about my previous experiences. Third one was easy SQL question, one probability question and a quick Q&A. The last one was with the senior manager of the team, so it was mainly consisting of behavioral questions, company fit.,I did not believe when I read here on Glassdoor that the process is this fast. In a week, I heard back to schedule another interview over the phone, a quick one with the VP. It was again questions about company fit and how much I know about the company.,I always loved the company's mission and followed CEO's podcast for quite a while now, so I believe that helped me in the process.

"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Zillow (Seattle, WA) in September 2017.",Zillow,"These Glassdoor reviews are supposed to be anonymous, but the informative part of my experience with Zillow is pretty specific, so it’ll be obvious to their recruiters who I am.,I came up to Seattle after working in San Francisco in the startup scene, and doing a 5 year graduate degree before that. The startup tech scene is volatile, so tenures at companies is shorter than average. I was at a super small start-up for about a year and a half before it went under, than another for about 10 months before my family decided it wanted to move to Seattle for a better life-style. I joined one of the huge tech companies in the area when we moved up here and very quickly learned that it wasn’t for me.,An engineering manager at Zillow reached out to me on LinkedIn after I’d been in Seattle for about 8 months. I’d heard good things about work/life at Zillow. I also happen to have a friend that I worked with at a previous company that is a senior engineer there who said good things, so I was happy to talk. We talked on the phone about the company, and found out that I was probably a better fit in a different org, so I was passed off to them. I ended up having coffee with another engineering manager, who was more aligned with my skills and desires, as my screen conversation. It went well. They were the kind of company that I like in size, workflow, and objectives and I was really familiar with their tech-stack, which made it a really easy fit. Between the internal referral I had and the conversation with the manager, they skipped the technical phone interview and just brought me onsite.,The onsite was pretty typical; a mix of pure coding questions, system design, ML theory, and ML system design. It was standard stuff, not easy, but appropriate for the senior eng. level for which I was applying. The feedback I got was really great, and everyone was very nice. I had a pretty good experience overall. The direct feedback I got from my recruiter was that I did really well in all technical aspects of the onsite interviews.,Their process then involved a quick 30min-1hour conversation with a director/VP as a validation. This is where it got weird. The recruiter warned me that the VP was going to ask me about my employment history, and why my tenure was short at my previous companies. Now, remember, Zillow contacted me, I didn’t apply; I spend some time at two start-ups, and I was in grad-school for half a decade before that.,I had never been in an interview where, from word one, I was sure the interviewer was dead-set against me and actively trying to come up with reasons I should fail, but that’s what happened. I was basically grilled about why I was interviewing with Zillow, like I had to justify talking with them after they had reached out to me. There was a lot of soft-skills questions, which is normal, but the tone was that the interviewer assumed I was a terrible person to work with, and was trying to find out what was wrong with me. If someone has made up their mind about you before you even speak, I’m not sure there is some specific arrangement of words that will overcome their biases.,But no, it got weirder. I was emailed by the recruiter and asked for some time to come back into the office for two, one hour long, interviews with two different VPs. I was confused, but agreed. I came in a few days after. When I came back into the office, I was told that the VPs I was supposed to interview with were unavailable and I was going to talk with the same VP I had talked with on the phone. This was the same person I had already spent a strange hour on the phone with. The conversation was basically a repeat of the previous one, except in this one they straight-up asked me why I would quit Zillow. I had to somehow come up with hypothetical reasons why I would quit their company. I don’t know what anyone else would do in that situation, but I really didn’t have an answer.,There was radio silence for two weeks, not even a polite rejection email. Then, when I was on vacation, I got a call from the recruiter again. They tried to be nice by saying that they didn’t have the budget to hire someone at my level, that they wanted principal level people right now, and that they might call me back at the start of the next fiscal year, but that seemed like it was probably cover.,This was several months ago, and I didn’t really want to air dirty laundry, but then again it does seem like this kind of experience is what places like Glassdoor are for.,I have nothing but good things to say about the people I interacted with, but if they have very senior people with particulars about not hinging people who worked at at startups, then it would have been better if they had not put me through this. I think they just need some better communication between their hiring manager and the recruiting org so that they can figure out what their filtering criteria and/or desired head-count is.",Average Interview,Negative Experience," ML theory, coding, system design, ML system design.

"I applied online. I interviewed at Zillow (New York, NY) in August 2017.",Zillow,"I initially applied to Zillow in June 2017 and forgot all about it. However I was pleasantly surprised when I got an email from a recruiter in August asking for a phone interview.,I scheduled a phone interview through one recruiter however I talked to another recruiter. I should have known this wasn't going to work out because on the first phone screen the recruiter was 15 minutes late. I was still interested in learning more about the company so I did not let that bother me.,When the recruiter did call, it was more of a conversation. Which I liked and she said that I moved on to the next round with a phone call with the sales manager. I was super happy.,It a took a while to schedule the second phone interview, however when it was schedule I was told verbally and in the email that the interview would be at 11:30am EST.,I ended up getting a call at 11:00 am EST instead and it wasn't with the Sales Manager it was with the Sales Team lead. Although I was surprised about the sudden change of time, I was prepared and I was able continue with the interview.,I was then told that I would be coming in for an in person interview. Prior to the interview I contacted the recruiter and asked if I needed to bring any copies of my resume and I was told no. Something told me to bring some extra copies anyway.,Anyway, the office and the location of the office was awesome. It is by everything . There are three interviews. The first two are with sales managers and the last one is with the General Manager.,The first two interviews seem to go really well. They seemed impressed by my answers and I got a really positive vibe from them. They gave me a tour around the office and even let me listen in on a couple of sales calls as well. I definitely saw myself at this company.,The last interview with the General Manager was the hardest. After listening to some of the calls the GM came up to me asked for a copy of my resume. Thank goodness I didn't listen to the recruiter and I had a copy of my resume on me. At that point I was starting to think they were testing me to see if I was prepared all the time. It wasn't that his questions were hard to answer. It was his personality. He was very cold towards me also I'm not from NYC area so it was hard for me to understand him because he had that NYC accent. So I had to take a couple of pauses so that I could make sure I heard him correctly. Anyway he asked questions about the last company I worked with, I was asked to pitch, I was asked why should they hire me.,I was prepared for all of that. I left there feeling pretty confident and I was told that I would hear by the end of the week about my results. Friday came and I didn't receive anything. I didn't worry about it though because it was the start of Labor Day weekend.,After the weekend I emailed one of the recruiters twice and didn't hear back. I emailed another recruiter and she told me that I should hear something back by Friday EOD and If I don't give her call.,Again, I didn't hear anything so I gave her call. No one picked up the phone. I left a voice message and about 45 minutes after I received a call at 6:30 pm from another recruiter saying that they are so sorry they are calling me late but they decided to move on with other candidates and this was a decision that they made on Wednesday. Before I could ask him for any feedback he said that he didn't have any feedback for me but he can set up some time with me on Monday and give me some feedback. He didn't give me any contact information so I'm sure the feedback conversation will not happen. Also I still haven't received an automatic email saying they have decided to move forward with other candidates.,I'm not going sit here and say that I'm not upset about this whole process, because I am.

"I applied online. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Zillow (Seattle, WA) in August 2017.",Zillow,"The first few steps in the interview process happened fairly quickly. I applied online through a job posting on LinkedIn, and about 2 days later a recruiting coordinator reached out to set up a quick phone screen with the lead recruiter. Had a 30 minute chat with her to go over my basic qualifications and experience. Within the next few days they set up a phone interview with the hiring manager. Oddly enough, it was only 30 minutes and very high level, but it went ok enough that they asked me to come in for a 90 minute interview the next day. Turns out it wasn't really an interview, but rather they wanted me to complete an Excel assessment. One of the marketing team members put me in a room with a laptop and handed me a spreadsheet with 3 sets of data and questions for each one. About an hour later, she came back and we review my answers. She asked a few random questions about my experience, and then it was over.,That was the last contact I had from them.

I applied online, had a phone interview with HR, another phone interview with the hiring manager, followed by an onsite interview with several members of the team. They were very welcoming and it seemed like a great culture. Overall, a positive experience. Most of the process went smoothly and the communication was great up until the end of the onsite interviews. Before I left the office, the recruiter mentioned that I would hear back in 2 weeks, so I followed up via email after 2 weeks. She then mentioned that they'll be in touch in about two weeks because the hiring manager was out of office. By then and after several follow ups, I hadn't heard back from the hiring manager or the recruiter. It was complete silence.,As mentioned in other interview reviews, highly encourage better follow ups so that the candidate isn't left with a negative experience at the end.

"I applied through an employee referral. The process took a week. I interviewed at Zillow (Seattle, WA) in May 2017.",Zillow,"My specific experience in the application process will probably not be *representative*, but I will describe it at length because I think it is *illustrative* of Zillow's frankly mythic-tier hiring.,I had previously interviewed mostly-well for a Data Scientist role that was ultimately reclassified above my experience level, but the hiring manager offered to pass me to the Economics team where a couple of Economist positions were open. After speaking with a director, we were mutually interested in an onsite, and began to schedule. That's where things went sideways.,Less than a week before the onsite (scheduled for 5-6 hours), another firm offered me a data scientist role with an acceptance deadline of the next day; and I was schedule to fly out of town. It was not a bad offer, but I was hoping to at least talk to the Zillow economists; so I emailed Zillow that evening and let them know my situation.,The next morning, I got a call from the hiring manager; he scrambled an onsite for that afternoon and even offered to rebook my flight to the following morning. So it was that on two hours' notice and three hours' sleep I came in for a (truncated) interview with the Zillow economics team.,And it was the best interview of my life. Their questions were fun and technical in an exploratory and creative rather than simply mechanical way, and I clicked with everyone. I saw four interviewers (three senior-plus economists and an editor) plus the hiring manager. Everyone was sharp and friendly-to-exuberant and clearly passionate about both their work and their team.,I got an offer about 45 minutes after the interview was over and immediately accepted. I should note on that point that I made no effort to engage in strategic behavior on compensation and that as far as I can tell there was no need to. Zillow seems to value paying up front market rates (or more--I don't actually know market rates for economists but I feel exceptionally well-compensated) and explicitly eschews used car salesman negotiation tactics.,TLDR: the Zillow hiring process is dreamy and if you have a chance to participate, savor it.,It's also apparently extremely effective in engendering new employee loyalty, as at this point I'm '' from getting the Zillow logo tattooed across my face.

I applied online. I interviewed at Zillow.,Zillow,"Terrible interview process. The whole process lasted for more than 2 months. The recruiter initially reached out to me asking for dates. After 3 weekly follow-ups, came back saying the hiring manager had put the position on hold (I understand that requirements can change) but isn't it courteous to let me know of it? On top of it, she comes back asking for another set of times and still the same behavior the second time around. At this point I give up on the company and just put it on my calendar to send out weekly follow-up emails anyway, to leave no stone unturned from my end. After the 2nd weekly follow-up she says she has me scheduled for a phone screen the very next day ( not sure how she assumed I was free at the exact time and date she proposed). At the proposed time, the recruiter does not call me. After waiting for 10 minutes, I write to her and she claims that she could not reach me on my phone (she obviously forgot) I try calling her up and she makes up another random excuse. She promises me over the call that the hiring manager is ""really interested in me"" and will reach out for some dates and times. No news from them for the next 4 weeks. So I assume the case is closed!,But NO! Here goes the second part of this saga. The same recruiter reaches out to me again asking for the same role with a different group. Exactly the same behavior the second time. But this time schedules a phone call after just 2 follow-ups. Iti s a different story altogether and she did not bother to call me at the scheduled phone screen time . No response to my email the entire evening either. I decide that enough is enough and I get hold of a different recruiter's email and write to her saying this is not acceptable. This recruiter comes back within hours, apologizing for not calling and immediately schedules another call the next day. This time she does call, BUT is entirely disinterested in talking to me. Asks me to talk about my background and doesnt even realize when I stopped talking. Moreover I get another apology for being so curt - the reason given : she is driving! Not sure why she scheduled that time in the first place. Asks me some times I am available for a call with the hiring manager. The call happens on a Friday evening. Just the regular tell me about yourself, behavioral questions - no surprises there. But I get an email over the weekend saying the position is filled!,This is the first impression they choose to put up in front of prospective employees.

I submitted an application through Zillow's career portal. A recruiter replied after a couple of weeks and set up a initial phone call. He asked me a few question about the usual things recruiters ask at this stage (i.e. how much do you make, are you legally authorized to work in the US, why Zillow?...). Then he set up a technical phone screening with a Senior Data Scientist.,The screening went well. I've done several phone interviews over my career and I can tell with a large degree of confidence how well/poorly I perform. Did I completely nailed it? No. But was it a performance worthwhile an onsite follow up? Yes, at least for most tech companies I've interviewed with (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Facebook,...).,Anyways, I never heard back from anyone at Zillow. Neither the recruiter, nor the guy scheduling the interviews (who, by the way, wrote that the recruiter would have been in contact with me within one week time).,I understand that we're all busy, but even though Zillow certainly has a large pool of applicants and can be picky about their selection, it it really that hard to have a canned email (thanks for your interest, bla bla, but we have decided to pursue other candidates that seem a better fit bla bla) to close out the loop?,Zillow seems like a great company that cares about their employees, maybe start showing you also care about people in general.",Average Interview,Negative Experience,,Senior Data Scientist,No Offer," Jun 26, 2017"

"The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Zillow (Seattle, WA) in January 2017.",Zillow,"Applied through campus career fair and received a online coding challenge email a week later. All my friends who applied all seem to received this challenge though. The online coding challenge has two questions: one easy question and one medium question. Be very careful about edge cases and programming style (maintainable, redundancy etc.) as this seems to be what is looked for. Then recruiter contacted me a few days after I completed the challenge informing me that I was in the second cut and will schedule a phone screen interview two weeks later.,The phone screen lasts 45-60 (60 minutes for me). A project manager asks about project experience first, then again two technical questions. This time one medium and one hard question (based on Leetcode.com difficulty ranking). Programming takes place on an online editor in HackerRank.com like the coding challenge. You won’t be able to test your code so be careful with syntax and do explain how your code works by working through small sample cases. I didn’t solve the hard one but articulated my thoughts clearly and had some good ideas about it. In the end the manager saved some time for me to ask questions and also asked typical questions like ‘why Zillow’. I did my research and prepared for these. Side note: be sure to asks questions to clarify specifications in technical questions when it’s ambiguous, as this is part of the question as well.,A few days later recruiter contacted me saying I moved forward and would like to schedule an onsite. I postponed the onsite till next year as there’s vacation in between.,I interviewed onsite early next year. Every interviewee will have to sign an NDA I suppose. The interview composed of 3 back-to-back one hour long interviews with three senior engineers from three different teams at Zillow. Same process for all 3 interviews: first interviewer asks parts he’s interested about your resume; then the technical question(s); finally some time for you to ask interviewer questions. Some interviewers ask an easy question at first. For these situations, manage your time wisely to allocate enough time for the hard one. My major onsite questions are all of hard difficulty. As always, go through general idea first, write clean code, and work through small sample cases. I didn’t solved all but solved majority. The whole onsite was very pleasant. Please prepare for basic data structures and related algorithms. And do practice (a lot of) other techniques, especially dynamic programming.,An exciting offer came shortly afterwards and I accepted it.

"I applied online. The process took 3+ months. I interviewed at Zillow (Seattle, WA) in December 2015.",Zillow,"The day after I applied for the Software Development Engineer, New Grad position, I was sent an email by a recruiter asking me to complete a coding challenge as the first phase of the interview process. The two challenges were to write a function to convert a string to an integer and to write the functionality for adding and removing nodes from a ternary tree. While these seem simple, it only takes a few minutes of looking through these Glassdoor reviews to see that many people do not get past this step. For the conversion function, keep in mind that there are many more numbers that can be represented by strings than can be represented by integers. For the ternary tree, make sure that all necessary connections between nodes are created on node addition and severed on node deletion. Spend a good amount of time carefully reading through the specifications provided in the challenge descriptions, as Zillow takes this portion of the process quite seriously.,After completing the online coding challenge, the recruiter reached out to me saying that I had made it to the next phase in the interview process, which involves one or two phone screens. Zillow uses a program called HackerRank for code sharing during these interviews, which allows for auto-indention and some basic text-highlighting, but not too much else. The first phone interviewer asked me a question that ultimately was to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. The second interviewer asked me to write a function to reverse a number. Both of these questions seem simple on the surface, but involve a lot of considerations as far as identifying the constraints of the problem and choosing appropriate data structures to complete the task in the most efficient way possible. It is important to always discuss trade-offs of different approaches, as there will almost always be multiple ways to tackle each problem. Do not let the apparent simplicity of a problem fool you into a poor performance in these interviews.,The final phase of the interview process was a day of on-site interviews. While most people on Glassdoor say that they had two or three one hour interviews, I actually completed four. Each of the interviews were formatted almost exactly the same way as the phone screens were, except in-person using a white-board wall to write code on. This seems fairly typical of tech companies, though. Again, the same tips apply here as in the phone interview phase, so just stay relaxed and honestly try to have fun with it. The interviewers I had were all great at challenging me to consider multiple approaches and adding new complexities to make the problems more interesting as the interviews went on.,The day following my on-site interviews, I received a phone call with an amazing offer to join the Zillow team!

The recruiter called me to let me know, but also said here was a similar position about to be posted with a different team, and she promised she would walk my resume down to the hiring manager herself when the job posts. In my opinion, this goes above and beyond. Most other recruiters would have sent an email saying sorry, the position is gone. Better luck next time. But not her. I got an email a week or so later saying the hiring manager for the new position wanted to move forward to the next step. I didn't even have to do another coding exercise!,I had a 30 minute tech interview with the hiring manager. The call went well and he told me that the recruiter would be in contact to setup the next steps. About a week or so later, I went in for the in-person interview. It was roughly 4 hours with 4 different people, 1 hour each. Even though it was more technical, it still felt just like having a conversation. A lot of back and forth, just bouncing ideas of each other.,Two days after the in-person interview, I got a call from the recruiter with an offer, which I happily accepted!

N/A,Zillow,I first heard of Zillow at a Career Fair held at my University. The recruiters were very nice and added me on LinkedIn the next day.

"I applied online. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Zillow (Seattle, WA) in April 2016.",Zillow,"The day of my in-person interview was interesting. I was escorted by JC of the talent team to the breakout room for the interview. JC is one heck of an asset. If I were to start another company, he would be my first hire. The first member of the management team came in and began his interview. He was passionate about Zillow and it showed. The second member of the management team followed. He was the hiring manager and it was quickly clear – he was the decision maker.,He walked into the room holding my resume and looked up and stated, “Can you tell me who you are again. I do lots of theses phone calls each week.” Prior to moving back to the PNW, I was an executive for two companies with 2.5X the market cap of Zillow. This is not bravado, but to give perspective. Having worked and sold to c-suite players to most of the Fortune 100, I understand this approach. Some experienced sales professionals like to begin meetings by putting the other party on their heels. I will say I was not prepared for this. Zillow was on my short list of companies to work for after having exited a company I started because of the leadership team and the leading edge culture they had developed. I immediately took his posturing as one of arrogance. It was the opposite of what I know of Rich Barton. It reeked of overconfidence.,Notwithstanding the message it sends to less experienced candidates, the hiring process is not a corollary to negotiating within the sales process. Companies, especially those who are in the consumer market like Zillow, should always ensure the hiring process represents the best of their company. For those 99% of candidates who aren’t tendered an offer of employment – you still want them to use your services. After the hiring manager left, the gentlemen running the business walked in and started it off by stating, “I usually only jump in for like five minutes as I leave the hiring to the manager responsible for the direct report.” Understandable view as you want to trust your managers as a leader. I will say the collective experience is one that comes off a little pretentious.,It’s hard to reconcile that Rich Barton founded Glassdoor to bring transparency to corporations and more specifically to provide employee candidates a ‘view’ into organizations they may want to join. Think about it, I can read from current and former employees about their respective experiences within Zillow. What I can’t do is ask any potential peers about their experiences during the onsite interview. I can’t ask any potential cubicle neighbors about the micro-culture within a department, which is always a reflection of department managers and directors. My point: your founder created Glassdoor to reduce opacity within corporations and yet as you have scaled it appears you are keeping candidates at arm’s length.,I am a firm believer all companies should allow a team to interview candidates. Specifically it should include team members who would be a peer to the potential hire. The candidate can garner far more recent information about a company’s culture, business processes, vision, from current employees rather than opinions expressed on Glassdoor. The fact there are only three members interviewing a candidate, all managers, can lead to groupthink (Irvine). Add this to the utilization of an ATS that purposefully keeps Zillow contact information close to the vest and it all feels very ostentatious.,If readers want to know if I was hired, I don’t think I was hired. At least no one in recruiting followed up with me to let me know. I did send an email to JC and asked that he let me know of feedback he may have received. JC replied that he had received positive feedback but that he would have an answer for me in a couple of days. It’s been much longer than that. I guess I could log into Jobvite to tell me I wasn’t selected, but that’s really not necessary. Clearly I wasn’t a fit and that’s OK. I'm interviewing them as much as they are interviewing me.,Based upon other reviews here it seems quite common that Zillow doesn’t like to share bad news. It’s really not that difficult. It should be pragmatic. Hiring isn’t objective. It’s subjective and it’s usually because there is some sort of emotional connection between the candidate and the hiring team. If it’s not there, for whatever reason, just explain that to the candidate and move on. Please don’t think a candidate should be responsible for checking with an ATS as to their candidate status. You’re better than that.,There is no need to re-invent the wheel. Zillow has a great leadership team, a great product, and a framework for success. This review isn’t to discourage any prospective candidates and it probably won’t. Zillow will continue to lead their segment, but it may be wise to look at other companies who are also leading edge when it comes to culture. Zappos has a core value that may fit well here: “Be humble.”",Average Interview,Neutral Experience," Please tell me who you are again as I do a lot of these phone (screening) calls each week?   ,1 Answer",Senior Sales Consultant,No Offer," Apr 28, 2016"

This call took about an hour, and consisted of basic screening questions. The recruiter that I worked with was very easy to talk to, and really helped keep the conversation on topic, but in a very personable way. I left the call feeling as though the company was truly interested in my technical capabilities, but that they also cared deeply about who I am as a person, and how I would fit with their team. I am a big fan of a strong company culture, so this really resonated with me.,The initial phone screening was followed up by a second phone screen, but this time by another program manager. This interview was much more technical, and for my role included deep conversations on agile methodologies and software development best practices. My interviewer was very open and very honest about any question I had for him. I deeply respected his transparency, as I often feel that in the interview process you are not always told the whole truth. I left this phone interview feeling very comfortable with the role, the current state of things, and their anticipated future goals.,The two phone screens were followed up by an in-person interview at the Irvine offices.

Just like a company wants to hear from their potential employees what great things you can bring and do for their company you would expect the same from a company specially one like Zillow. When I asked one of the hiring managers what we're the growing opportunities within the company one of the responses was ""There is really no room for growth, sure you can move to tear 2 customer service and maybe lead but that's about it!""?... or how about this ridiculous answer ""well there is really no room for growth we had some cases of people who do but those are the exception!""... I would have rather been told that I wasn't a good fit for the position and be thanked for my time, a McDonald's manager can interview better than that.

The way to make sure your code gets selected is to document very well and add unit tests to cover all possible cases. Also, make sure you send it in 24 hours. After 10 days they get back saying I passed the coding test and wanted to set up a phone interview. The hiring manager literally asked me to solve the problem for their project.

"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Zillow (Seattle, WA) in November 2015.",Zillow,"Initially was contacted by a recruiter via LinkedIn, which lead to a phone conversation with that same recruiter. That conversation was more so for me to learn about the company and position, which was helpful. After doing more research on Zillow and the position, I let the recruiter know I was interested in interviewing.,It took the recruiter at least two weeks to get back to me, and during that time I followed up with her several times just to get a response. I'm not sure I would have heard back from her had I not been a bit pushy. However, this method worked and I did receive an interview.,Once it was time for my interview, I went to the lobby as I was instructed and checked in with the front desk. The girl I checked in with was very disinterested and not very helpful. I waited in the lobby for 15 to 20 minutes before the recruiting assistant got me, and took me into a small 2 to 3 person room. She also seemed very disinterested, wrote her number down on a whiteboard if I needed anything, and then told me the person I would be interviewing with would be in soon and that she would be back to follow up after my actual interview was complete.,I waited in the room for 5 to 10 minutes, and then the manager came in to interview me. The first part of the interview was typical, and I was just asked questions about my experience and resume. The manager was a bit stiff but nice, and that portion of it went fine and there were no surprises.,The next part was the test. I was given a computer with Excel open, which had three different marketing/SEM questions, each on different tabs. The first was a table that had sales numbers of different shoes throughout the years, and I was supposed to identify the trend. The second had questions about generic PPC stuff (calculate CTR, conversion rate etc) and the next had more B2B style questions, which were pretty vague.,I was given 30 minutes to complete the test, and the manager came back in and went over it with me. I was honest and said I struggled with finding the answer to the trend question, and her response was that there is no right answer. Would have been good to know before I started, as the way it was written completely implies there is one. That started the test review off on the wrong foot, but I recovered well enough on the other two questions.,After that, she left it to me to ask her questions about the role and the company, and then let me know the recruiter would be back to get me and would tell me about next steps. I couldn't get a great read on the manager, but I felt my interview went well enough to have a shot at another.,After that I waited for the recruiter to come and get me. I sat patiently for 10 or so minutes, and then started to get concerned no one was actually coming to get me. I waited a bit longer, and a random employee comes in and asks who I am, I let him know and he went to hunt down the recruiter. I waited another few minutes, and then tried to call the number she left me on the whiteboard. She failed to inform me how the internal phone system works, so after failing to get in touch with her (and not wanting to call random employees on accident) I stopped and waited a bit longer.,After at least 20 minutes, I decided I couldn't wait any longer, as it was the end of the working day and I was afraid she just went home. I walked across the office with little idea where I was going, and made it back to the front desk which had another person now manning it. I let him know what happened, and then he tried to get in contact with the recruiter.,After another 15 or 20 minutes of waiting in the lobby, the recruiting assistant finally came back and let me know the initial recruiter that got in touch with me was suppose to be the one to get me for the follow up, but she was on business trip. I received no apology, and was told I would hear back from them after the holidays. This was before Thanksgiving, so I wasn't really sure what that meant.,I left the office with a really bad taste in my mouth, but gave myself a 50/50 shot to get a second interview. After not hearing back for weeks, I emailed the original recruiter after Thanksgiving to follow up, and I received a generic ""we're going with other candidates"" message within an hour. So again, had I not followed up I wouldn't have even received a response.,I'm sure Zillow is a great place to work, and the reviews on Glassdoor and other publications support that. However, the interview process was disrespectful, unorganized, and the test I was given was confusing and poorly worded. This may all just be because of the recruiting department, or the specific recruiting team I worked with. However, even had I received another interview I don't know if I would have taken it, as the whole thing gave me a bad feeling about the company.",Average Interview,Negative Experience," Multiple marketing questions on an Excel worksheet.

"I applied online. The process took a week. I interviewed at Zillow (Seattle, WA).",Zillow,"In a nutshell, Zillow is a joke. For those looking for more details, read on.,First, a bit of background info. I have close to 15 years of server side Java development experience, with focus on design, architecture, distributed systems, latency and throughput optimizations, scalability and fault tolerance. Writing code is what I do for a living, and I have made a pretty good living doing it because I am good at what I do, and I have done it working for successful companies throughout my career. So hopefully that puts to rest any doubts regarding my suitability for their open dev jobs.,Now, on to what happened with the company. My first experience with them was late last year when they contacted me in connection with my application to one of their open positions. Long story short, timing wasn't right and I couldn't move forward with them. Recently, I decided to send in my resume again through their general HR inbox, and got their canned annoying response generated by Jobvite. So then I sent the resume directly to the email address of the recruiter I had dealt with last year. This time, I got a bite and after a short conversation with the HR person, I was sent a link to their coding test on HackerRank. They give you 48 hours to complete the test once it begins, and it consisted of two problems. The first one was preposterously simple, and the second one was moderately difficult but if you know what to consult with (hint: JDK source code), then it really just boils down to understanding the problem and customizing the existing, well known logic to the specific problem. So I completed both problems, well within the time allotted, tested against not just provided sample input but also with my custom test cases and made sure everything worked.,Today I get a reply from their Jobvite box that says exactly this: ""Thank you for your interest in Zillow and especially for the time you took to complete the coding test. As promised, I sent your solution & resume to the hiring manager. Unfortunately, we have decided not to move forward with your application to the next step. We wish you well in your pursuit of a new position and thank you again for your time."" WTF??? Did anyone even bother to read the code, or run it?

I wrote my own unit tests to validate other cases. The next day they let me know that I passed the test. The next step was a phone screen. It was a very good conversation and the interviewer was very nice. The coding exercise was to write a function that detects the first non-repeating character in a char array, and to do so with only a single pass over the array. Unfortunately, I was a bit sloppy and nervous with the coding exercise in the online text editor, so even though I solved it with the time/space efficiency they were looking for, I'm sure the code had some syntax errors and was not as elegant as I would have liked. They let me know the next day that they were not interested in talking with me further.

The in-person and on-sites were fairly standard, with an unsurprising focus on their business. I received an offer.

My on-site day went smoothly and had extra time at the end where I was able to do casual meet-ups with engineering and PM team members. Post-on-site there was follow-up from various executives and the hiring manager interested in talking to me in detail about Zillow's future and their thoughts on how I could grow with them.

I leisurely completed it about a week later and sent it back, along with some additional feedback I had regarding some things that were not asked for but I felt were important to note.,The same day as I submitted my coding test I received an email saying the next step is a technical phone interview with the team manager. We scheduled it for a few days later. On the call I was asked about my experience, as well as some fairly simple and common technical questions regarding databases and programming.

The on-site interview consisted of meeting with 3 different people. The first was the recruiter who I had been in contact with. The second was one of the engineers on the team I would be working with, and the third was the team manager (the same one I had the call with). I was also scheduled to meet with the VP, but he was out of the office at the time, so we had a follow-up call two days later.,The team manager gave me a code test, in which I had to take a dollar amount and convert it into a textual representation.

The question was written on a whiteboard and I was given about 30-40 minutes to write out my answer on the whiteboard. The team manager left the room and came back every so often to check up on my progress. I really liked the fact that he would leave the room, since it relieved a lot of the pressure of someone hovering over your shoulder. For about half the time I studied the question and possible solutions before really getting into the heart of the solution.,I came up with what I felt was a good solution, and made sure to document any errors or missteps I had taken (as he had requested) to show my thought process. Once the time was up, he came back in and asked me to explain my solution. I went through my thought process and explained my solution, answering a couple of questions he had as I went along. The solution wasn't a complete, working set of code, but rather pseudo-code that was meant to demonstrate the solution, which he had explained was perfectly fine.,The other interviewers were more of the question and answer type of interviews, comprised mostly of back and forth about my experience, how I go about solving problems, etc. It was fairly informal overall.

"I applied online. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Zillow (Seattle, WA) in April 2015.",Zillow,"The interview process took about three weeks. It started with an informal phone call with a recruiter, followed by a take home coding test and then two 45 minute phone interviews. After the second phone interview I received an email stating that they would not be moving forward with me. I believe the next stage would have been an in person interview loop.,The take home coding test was a Trinary search tree as others have described. I think the main point of the exercise is too see how you handle duplicate entries as the time complexity can be constant or linear depending on how you handle this case. I also wrote a bash script that ran several test cases on the Trinary Search Tree out of input files and output the result to the terminal. There was a second question regarding converting a String to a Long which has some tricky edge cases that must be accounted for and I wrote a test script for that too.,The two 45 minute interviews were pretty standard. I don't remember the exact questions for the first but they were basic coding tests done on collabedit.

The first had me do a code sharing phone screen interview with one of their manager but I was informed that the position had been filled. Then a week later they told me that they had a few more job openings for me and that they would still like to interview me. The second step was a take home test. It was the same 2 questions that they ask everyone. I sent it the next day but the recruiter could not figure out how to unzip a file so she asked me a week later to send it to her as two different files. A week later they told me I had passed and asked me to do a second phone screen (also code sharing). It was very straight-forward and a few days later they told me they wanted me to interview on site. And asked me to fly there for a file round of interviews.,I was quite disappointed by the on-site. They have changed my schedule 4 times, asked me to change room during the process, interviewers would leave me and had me wait alone for the next interviewer to show.

The first one was about data structure and was not too difficult. The second one was with a manager who was full of himself and kept to make weird comments and talk bad about his coworkers and Amazon (I never mentioned them). He sounded like a terrible human being and had no desire to work with him. His question was about object oriented design and had nothing to do with what zillow does. The third one was with another manager and she was much nicer, the question was a fun and challenging puzzle.

It took some time to get to this point after being notified I was selected for review - I think this particular recruiter was in over her head.,Phase Two - Detailed phone screening by database engineer. The person I talked to was very friendly and made it more of a professional assessment of both my knowledge and attitudes toward the skills associated with my career than a detailed grilling. He seemed pretty encouraging; I was passed to phase three about five minutes after the end.,Phase Three - A series of four one-on-one interviews - three with top database engineers and the fourth with the team development manager. The first hour consisted of schema design and query optimization principles - very well done and with excellent assessment questions. The second hour was mostly focused on the inner workings of SQL Server and concepts that separate senior developers from junior and mid-level devs. He fired off a lot of canned questions as well as some personal introspection questions and was very enjoyable. The third hour focused on query skills and was led by an interviewer who was very honest about being unprepared and distracted by an upcoming trip. The final hour (with the team lead) was more standard ""how well do you play with others in the sandbox"" questions. This was important in that I got a sense of a co-worker I would be working directly with, if not supervised by. She asked numerous thoughtful questions about work environment issues and that sort of thing and was - importantly to me - very likable. After the final interview my new recruiter (who was much more on the ball than the original one) introduced herself and asked some follow-up questions and finished with a tour of the facility.,Aside from the initial recruiter who seemed to keep losing my reply emails to requests for information (to be fair, I was told she was no longer with Zillow by the end of the process, so factor her out of the process subsequently) I found everyone to be friendly, professional and very encouraging.

Questions: I answered them all correctly and at the best of my knowledge and solutions were nice and elegant. The interviewer seemed had only one target in mind - not to verify my knowledge, but to ask question I can't answer (but I answered them all correctly). It seemed like he had somebody in mind already and this interview was just an unpleasant formality for him. Next day recruiter pinged me back and said they decided to proceed with some other candidate. On my ask to provide a feedback what went wrong and what I can improve - recruiter didn't answer at all! Few days later multiple people told me that if you're not a buddy with a hiring manager - you'll not be hired at Zillow. I think it is 100% true based on my experience. Oh, and that sexual harassment lawsuit against Zillow - OK, fine, it didn't affect my desire to try Zillow, yet a lot of my friends asked me if I really want to get job in the company with such reputation (again, I wouldn't blame the company, just some people). Finally, I hope Zillow CEO is reading these reviews and takes them into consideration. If so, Spencer, there's a huge issue with the Software Development department in Zillow you may face and hopefully will solve - a ""buddy-bringing"" and rejecting other very good and talented candidates.

Questions were about Javascript, and vaguely remember one about encapsulation and closures. I was invited for an onsite interview a few days later.,Onsite started around 1 PM and lasted until 5-6 PM.

Coding on a whiteboard wasn't something I had done for a while, but the interviewer seemed satisfied. Next interview was with another engineer, and this was the most enjoyable interviewer because we discussed various technologies and just had a good time talking. Third interview was with another engineer who dived into arrays and algorithms. I'm not a CSE major, but the purpose was to assess problem solving ability. I enjoyed this as well because the interviewer wasn't trying to make you feel bad at all, but instead understood I didn't have a CSE background and wanted to see if I could understand the purpose of the exercise.,The fourth and final was with the most senior engineer who subsequently started the talk by saying how he's related to someone rich and famous. Not the best way to start things and definitely did not give off a good first impression. He wanted to continue the discussion on arrays, but unlike the previous person he made it feel like he wanted you to feel bad about not knowing his solution. I was already tired from the previous interviews so couldn't come up with additional solutions besides the one I had already presented.,A day or two later I was notified that the senior engineer had chosen someone else, which I wasn't surprised by given the vibe I got.

"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Zillow (Seattle, WA) in June 2013.",Zillow,"Zillow's interview and hiring process for there ""Inside Sales Consultant"" position feels more like a cattle drive than a search for quality sales people. Their recruiting staff has no professional tact and is completely un-organized and not on the same page within their own department. Let me just break down how the whole process worked from start to finish:,1. I saw that their Seattle office was hiring Inside Sale people and I had a friend who works for them refer me to a recruiter.,2. He then called me and said that the recruiter liked the looks of my resume and that she would be calling me later that day for a phone screen (those were the recruiters exact words to my friend)... However, that day came to pass and the recruiter never called.,3. Two days later I finally got a call from the recruiter for my first phone screen, that conversation went well, so she then set up my second phone interview with a Sales Manager. The Sales Manager was much more on top of it than the recruiter and he actually called me when he was scheduled to (imagine that). That phone interview also went well and I was then told by the Sales Manager that a different recruiter would be calling me to se up a face-to-face interview.,4. I showed up for the face-to-face interview which lasted about an hour (with multiple Sales Managers) and then I was sent on my way home. The recruiter told me after the interview that they were looking to hire people quickly and that I would be receiving a call the next day to let me know either yes or no... Once again, the recruiter didn't call the next day. THREE DAYS LATER, she sent me a generic e-mail stating; ""thanks for your interest, but we're pursuing other candidates). Not even a phone call.,5. I wanted a reason why they chose not to go with me, so that I could better myself for future interviews as I job search, so I called the recruiter... No answer, so I left her a voicemail. She never returned my call, so I sent her an e-mail. She never returned that e-mail either.,6. To top it all off, six days later I ended up getting an e-mail from a different Zillow recruiter asking me to call him because he thinks I'd be a great fit for their Inside Sales Position.........,So, if you like run-arounds with big corporations, people not keeping their commitments, and being ignored once you're (apparently) ""out of the running"", Zillow is definitely the company for you!",Average Interview,Negative Experience," They through me into a roll playing senario for a cold call.   ,Answer Question",Inside Sales Consultant,No Offer," Jul 11, 2013"

Pretty basic ""tech start up"" sort of atmosphere, including free drinks and recreation like ping pong, foosball and xBox, along with requisite free drinks and snacks.,Got the feeling that the interviewers were looking more for intelligence and ""cultural fit"" as opposed to specific job skills.

"The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Zillow (Seattle, WA) in November 2011.",Zillow,"The Zillow recruiter found my profile on LinkedIn and contacted me about a position at the company. I was open to the possibility of a job switch, so I agreed to a phone screen. After talking with the recruiter at length, a follow up phone screen was scheduled with the hiring manager.,When it was time to have the call, the hiring manager didn't call. I waited for 45 minutes, and then I let the recruiter know by email I had to some other other things to attend to. Two minutes later, the hiring manager called, but I was on another line and they left a voice mail. We rescheduled the call for a week later. Next time, the hiring manager called on time. The hiring manager asked a lot about my current role, which was appropriate. But then proceeded to grill me on Zillow's prospects and keys to their competitive advantage. Typically, a phone screen is just a sniff test. In my experience, the hardball questions don't get rolling until the all-day in-person interview loop. Needless to say I was unprepared for a case study analysis of the company. Lesson learned.,Anyway, the call was pleasant enough and I think I demonstrated an interest and ability to creatively tackle complicated business problems. But after the phone screen, I heard not a peep. Neither the hiring manager nor the recruiter bothered to respond back to inquiries since then. It's pretty easy to say, ""we'll be in touch"", or ""we're going in a different direction"", or ""there was one thing that hiring manager wanted to clarify"". Instead, I got crickets. The silent treatment was ironic since the company pursued me in the first place. In an boutique labor market like Seattle where everyone will eventually work with everyone else, seems to me that is pretty short-sighted recruiting.",Difficult Interview,Negative Experience," Will the company succeed?

I heard back from a recruiting coordinator within a few days and he set up a phone call to discuss my interest in the position and my background. After that, he directed me to another recruiting coordinator who helped get me set up with a phone screen interview. Though the position was heavy on Java, I was allowed to answer questions from a C# perspective since I had more experience with that language. Overall, the conversation I had with the phone screener went well, but I think the general feeling on both sides was that I wasn't the best fit given my weakness with Java/server development and perhaps a little too much management experience (since I was used to managing teams with both direct and indirect reports).

The job description didn't quite talk about what you would be selling, however, with some research, I figured it out. I found that the interviews involved lots of free-flowing conversations and showed that the culture was very laid back, especially since there are no set pitches or scripts. Learned that each salesperson has his or her own style. The interview questions were behavioral and involved asking questions like, ""How would you describe the ideal work environment/manager?"" to see if your views matches what they can provide.

"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 3 days. I interviewed at Zillow (Seattle, WA) in February 2007.",Zillow,"First, phone screens by HR, then by prospective supervisor. HR phone screen checked to see what my background was, what I knew about the company, why I was interested in working for same, what skills i thought I brought to bear, a little probing to basically see what kind of person I was. Supervisor phone screen was pretty brusque (though not unfriendly) - i got the feeling that the reason I was being hired was because the team was drowning in work, so stopping to interview was tricky. Mostly problem-solving hypotheticals, as well as some checking on previous work history and skills. In person 1:1s (there were no firing-squad or group interviews) were more or less the same. Brief with the supervisor (who didn't seem to really remember what he had and hadn't asked me, but generally seemed ok with me, still seemed crazy busy). Then 1:1s with both of the other team members, one of whom asked problem-solving questions, the other of whom mostly asked about what I had done before and what I knew/didn't know. Then a 1:1 with a member of the DBA team (who are the closest Ops partners to our team, since we support the machines their DBs live on) - which was pretty much a personality-fit-check. Finally, 1:1 with the head of Ops, who was clearly an old-school geek, and who did more skill-and-history probing, largely asking what I had done, what i wanted to do, and trying to find out the limitations of my knowledge, as well as getting me to own those limitation (which I had/have no problem doing, and which he seemed to appreciate/approve of). He also told a couple of old-school-geek war stories, as geeks are wont to do. Throughout the process, i was very candid about what I had and hadn't done, and did and didn't know. I think that this was taken at face value by my interviewers, and may have helped my chances. Also, I'm pretty easy-going, and I get the impression that this netted me more points than if I had been highly-skilled and a jerk. There is definitely a big focus on fit at Zillow, such that having the skills is not sufficient if you don't also have a get-along attitude that coheres with the feel of the company. This is wise, I think, since it cuts down on the cycles that are spent managing interpersonal tensions or repairing problems that arise from bad communciation resulting from those tensions. Good for morale, good for product.

I applied online. The process took 6 weeks. I interviewed at Zillow.,Zillow,"I was very surprised by how unprofessional the interview process was handled. First, I was invited to interview with someone from HR over the phone. The HR person called me and I was immediately thrown off guard by the first question which was, ""Are you looking for a relocation package?"" I live in Europe so it was a fair question, but certainly not the first question they should be asking. The HR person continued with a number of other questions but all in all seemed very uncomfortable talking on the phone and completely unprepared for the interview. There were constant ""uhs"" and ""ums"" as she scrambled to come up with questions and her overall speaking style was completely chaotic and awkward. She also couldn't answer a single question about the details of the position. To be honest, I've never encountered an HR person who was so bad at giving interviews.,About two weeks later I was sent another email by the same person who had first emailed me, thanking me for my application and inviting me to interview with someone from HR. The email was identical to the first one and it was clearly a mistake for them to send it again. I understand that mistakes happen but after the initial interview this only further highlighted the lack of organization.,I responded to the second email making it clear that I had already interviewed with HR so that they would recognize the mistake. They did and I was quickly invited to a follow-up interview with someone from the marketing department. This interview was better than the first and the person was at least able to answer my questions about the position. However, the situation was awkward as I wasn't really meant to be invited to the second interview.,To top it all off, 4 weeks later I was sent the standard thank you email informing me that someone else had been selected for the position. However, the position listed in the email was for a Senior Marketing Specialist not the Campaign Manager position that I applied for. I'm not sure if this was another mistake or if they changed the position title, but it was still odd.,In any case, I'm sure there are some very talented people working at Zillow and I don't mean to make the entire company sound unprofessional.
